I want to build a bounty system for lifecycle analyses (LCAs). The goal would be to crowdsource LCAs and reduce the cost and time for sustainability engineers to perform them.

A lifecycle analysis quantifies the environmental impact of a product or service.

they're very straightforward and generally don't take too long to do, however the current system is heavily centralized and can take months to put in the order to get them done

like some of them only take a few hours, but the process of negotiating/bidding with companies that do them is unnecessary

I hope to build a bounty system to connect groups who need LCAs with engineers and pay on a job-to-job basis.
