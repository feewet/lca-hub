Description

The basis of this project is to build a bounty system for Life Cycle Assessments (LCA). The goal would be to crowdsource LCAs and reduce the cost and time for sustainability engineers to perform them.

A lifecycle analysis quantifies the environmental impact of a product or service. Organizations use LCAs to inform decisions regarding sustainability and implementation of sustainable policies.

We believe the current system to create LCAs is heavily centralized. Both organizations and engineers can benefit greatly from a decentralized system to draft and verify life cycle assessments. Under the current system, engineers must work through a third party such as a government or corporation in order to complete 

The length of LCAs varies on a project-to-project basis, however they are often very straightforward and involve chemical reactions and dimensional analysis. Engineers often use software such as GaBi to assist in creating and streamlining LCAs.

A goal of this platform is to help engineers reach consensus about sustainability goals and product lifecycles. Contributors are incentivised to validate lifecycle assessments and share them with the public.
