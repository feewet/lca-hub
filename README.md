# Description

The goal of this project is to help engineers reach consensus about sustainability goals and product lifecycles. Contributors are incentivised to validate lifecycle assessments and share them with the public.

The basis of this platform is a bounty system for Life Cycle Assessments (LCA). We can allow for the crowdsourcing of LCAs and reduce the cost and time for sustainability engineers to perform them.

## Life Cycle Assessments (LCA)

A Life Cycle Assessment quantifies the environmental impact of a product or service. Organizations use LCAs to inform decisions regarding sustainability and implementation of sustainable policies.

The length of LCAs varies on a project-to-project basis, however they are often very straightforward and involve chemical reactions and dimensional analysis. Engineers often use software such as GaBi to assist in creating and streamlining LCAs.

We believe the current system to create LCAs is heavily centralized. Both organizations and engineers can benefit greatly from a decentralized system to draft and verify life cycle assessments. Under the current system, engineers must work through a third party such as a government or corporation in order to complete these reports.

# Spec

### Identity Verification Flow

* Engineers will sign up and have their qualifications and identity verified and linked to their ethereum address. Smart contract maps valid addresses to true

* Verified engineers are able to manually validate LCAs by signing them.

### Bounty Submission Flow

* Anyone can upload a project description and

### LCA Submission Flow

* Anyone can upload a description

### LCA Approval Flow

* Once an LCA has been verified 3 times, the bounty is paid to the submittor
